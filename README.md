### Oh, you finally found this corner of the web!  Hi 👋 I'm Shantanu

I'm an undergrad student 👱‍♂️ pursuing my Computer Science degree in Mumbai.<br> 
I tried my hand at Flutter and absolutely fell in love with it, also my favorite color is blue, so a match made in heaven right?! 💙. <br>
Knack for making code work, learning how to make that code efficient 👨‍💻. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Flutter Intern at FOLK Developers 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with React, Node, Express; basically WebDev 🙋‍♂️
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm decent at most sports, also have way too much unecessary knowledge to win Trivia quizzes 🤓
